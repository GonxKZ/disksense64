# DiskSense64 - Cross-Platform Disk Analysis Suite

## Project Status Report

### Overview
DiskSense64 is a comprehensive disk analysis suite that provides four core capabilities:
1. **Exact File Deduplication** with hardlinks
2. **Disk Space Visualization** with treemap charts
3. **Residue Detection and Cleanup** of orphaned files
4. **Perceptual Duplicate Detection** for images and audio

### Current Status

#### ‚úÖ Completed Components
- **Cross-Platform Architecture**: Supports Windows (32/64-bit) and Linux (32/64-bit)
- **Modular Design**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Core Libraries**: 
  - Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256, BLAKE3)
  - Perceptual hashing for images
  - Cross-platform utilities
- **Build System**: CMake configuration with cross-compilation support
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, contribution guidelines, and licensing

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress
- **CLI Application**: Core functionality implemented but with linking issues
- **GUI Application**: Basic structure in place but needs full implementation
- **Advanced Features**: Some modules need completion (residue detection, similarity)

#### üöß Issues to Resolve
- **Linking Problems**: BLAKE3 functions not properly linking in build
- **Platform Integration**: Some Windows-specific features need Linux equivalents

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Modules
1. **Scanner**: File system traversal with size-based filtering
2. **Index**: LSM-based persistent index with memory mapping
3. **Engine**: Cross-platform I/O scheduler (IOCP on Windows, epoll on Linux)
4. **Ops**: File operations including deduplication
5. **Model**: Core data structures

#### Libraries
1. **chash**: Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256, BLAKE3)
2. **phash**: Perceptual hashing for images
3. **utils**: Cross-platform utility functions
4. **Platform Wrappers**: OS-specific abstractions

### Build Status
- **Source Code**: ‚úÖ Complete and well-structured
- **CMake Configuration**: ‚úÖ Cross-platform support implemented
- **CLI Compilation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Linking issues with BLAKE3 functions
- **GUI Compilation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal implementation

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Fix BLAKE3 linking issues
   - Complete CLI application functionality
   - Implement basic GUI features

2. **Medium-term Goals**
   - Complete residue detection and cleanup modules
   - Implement perceptual similarity detection
   - Add advanced deduplication features

3. **Long-term Vision**
   - Full GUI implementation with visualization
   - Performance optimization for all platforms
   - Package managers integration
   - Automated deployment and distribution

### Conclusion
The DiskSense64 project has a solid foundation with a well-designed cross-platform architecture. The core components are in place, and the build system supports multiple platforms. The main issues to resolve are linking problems and completing the implementation of advanced features. With focused effort on these areas, DiskSense64 will become a powerful tool for disk analysis and optimization across multiple operating systems.
