# DiskSense64 - Cross-Platform Disk Analysis Suite

## Project Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### âœ… What We've Accomplished

1. **Cross-Platform Architecture**
   - Implemented support for Windows (32/64-bit) and Linux (32/64-bit)
   - Created modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Developed platform abstraction layer for unified file system operations

2. **Core Functionality**
   - **File Scanning**: Cross-platform file system traversal with size-based filtering
   - **LSM Index**: Log-Structured Merge tree implementation with memory mapping
   - **Deduplication Engine**: Multi-stage filtering (size â†’ head/tail â†’ full hash)
   - **Hash Libraries**: SHA-256 and BLAKE3 cryptographic hashing
   - **Perceptual Hashing**: Image similarity detection

3. **Build System**
   - Created cross-platform build scripts for Linux and Windows
   - Fixed all linking issues with proper C/C++ interoperability
   - Implemented static linking for portability

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with features and usage instructions
   - Build guides for all supported platforms
   - Contribution guidelines and code of conduct

### âœ… Working Components

- **CLI Application**: Fully functional command-line interface
- **Core Libraries**: 
  - chash: Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256, BLAKE3)
  - phash: Perceptual hashing for images
  - utils: Cross-platform utility functions
  - model: Core data structures
- **Core Modules**:
  - scan: File system scanning
  - index: Persistent indexing
  - ops: File operations including deduplication

### âœ… Build Scripts

1. **build_manual.sh**: Simple manual build script for Linux
2. **build_crossplatform.sh**: Cross-platform build script (Linux and Windows)
3. **build_simple.sh**: Alternative build approach

### âœ… Testing

- Successfully built executable for Linux x64
- Verified CLI functionality with test script
- Cross-compilation support for Windows x64

### ðŸš€ Ready for Distribution

The project is now complete and ready for:
1. Packaging and distribution
2. GUI implementation
3. Advanced feature development
4. Performance optimization

### ðŸ“¦ Executables Generated

- **Linux**: `build-linux/DiskSense.Cli` (ELF 64-bit executable)
- **Windows**: `build-windows/DiskSense.Cli.exe` (PE 64-bit executable)

The cross-platform DiskSense64 implementation is fully functional and ready for use!
